Innovative Projects
==========================

###### For students
> Do you want to get more **programming know-how** and professional experience? Or maybe you are **bored with academic projects** which end on a bookshelf? Or you want to see how programmers work in a **big software company**? Choose any project from the list, bring your friends and start coding. Let's do some **awesome** shit together.

######  For Nokia employees
> Are you getting bored at work? Do you have an **amazing idea**, but no clue how to make it happen? Or maybe you have an amazing idea, but **no time** to implement it?
> Create something new with a passionate group of students. **Master you tutor skills** and share your knowledge with others

Innovative Projects is an idea of cooperation between Nokia and universities. For each academic semester Nokia announces a list of topics which students can implement during their lectures or free time. Author of an idea becomes a tutor and helps the students in the project. 

In case of any questions, proposals or improvements just write to us: innovative.projects@nsn.com
