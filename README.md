Innovative Projects
==========================
Are you getting bored at work? Do you have an **amazing idea**, but no clue how to make it happen? Or maybe you have an amazing idea, but **no time** to implement it?

Create something new with a passionate group of students. **Master you tutor skills** and share your knowledge with others

Innovative Projects is an idea of cooperation between NSN and universities. For each academic semester NSN announces a list of topics which students can implement during their lectures or free time. Author of an idea becomes a tutor and helps the students in the project. 

##### Current list of available topics: [PDF](InnovativeProjects%20-%20Topics.pdf)
