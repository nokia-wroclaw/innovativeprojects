{ 
A company X hires a lot of workers. Workers track their work-time in excel, which is not handy and error-prone.

Project assumes development of two elements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Chrome plugin

			\item track daily work hours of employee and send that information to server
		\end{itemize}
	\item Web application
		\begin{itemize}
			\item visualizes work hours (timeline)
			\item displays additional information about work hours (week target, week overtime etc.)
			\item sends notification to manager about employee status
			\item generates reports

{Lightweight C++11 code model}
{Develop a plugin for Vim or Emacs which uses Clang to provide real-time
syntax highlighting, code completion and error/warning indication} 
{ 
Modern C++ IDEs such as Qt Creator or Microsoft Visual Studio provide code
models for real-time syntactic and semantic code analysis. This greatly enhances 
the programming experience, allowing for faster and more convenient development. 
However, sometimes developers are required to work on remote machines, e.g. via SSH. 
In such circumstances it is impossible to use heavy tools with sophisticated GUIs. 
On the other hand, console text editors do not provide satisfactory code models. 
Existing plugins are often difficult to configure and aimed mainly at graphical versions of the editors. 
They also cause significant problems when new C++11 constructs are used. The growing popularity of Clang,
a modern compiler which supports the full C++11 standard and provides a convenient API, seems to indicate 
the possibility to provide a lightweight plugin for one of the popular console text editors such as Vim or 
Emacs â€“ one that would support real-time syntax highlighting, code completion, compiler error/warning indication. 
 
The plugin will have to be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Load projects, preferably using CMake input files.
	\item Parse the headers and source files belonging to the project as well as
	system libraries to provide a list of available symbols.
	\item Perform on-the-fly code inspection, verifying its syntactic correctness and the symbols used.
	\item Provide real-time information on types of variables, class members and function arguments.
	\item Locate class and function declarations and definitions.

{
In big company work many people with different experience and competence. The problem is, to find person which has qualification, skills or knowledge, we are looking for at the moment.
Application which can hold map, tags or description of personal abilities will help many people. 
Application should give users such features like:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ability to traverse through company general abilities map
	\item Ability of create and manage own users map or maps, which can base on company map or its branch
	\item Ability of add, move or remove people from their own competence map
	\item Add, remove competence tags to selected people
	\item Add, remove and edit competence description to selected persons
	\item Ability of search people competence by tags or words in description
	\item Display  the degree if coverage tags with other users data 
	\item User friendly interface for desktops and mobile devices
\end{itemize}
The project will have 3 phases:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Development
	\item Implementation for internal use, without general company map (users can create their own maps, add tags and descriptions)
	\item Development of aggregation tool which help to gain all knowledge about specified people and after that create general company competence map
	\item Implement tool and create such map
\end{itemize}
When user decides that his fellow has some knowledge in some discipline, he add profile of his fellow to his map. User specifies how to tag this knowledge and where he can find this person - also tag with department name or team name.
When user after some time have such problem and doesn't remember how can help, he get in this application and search people with such tags.
