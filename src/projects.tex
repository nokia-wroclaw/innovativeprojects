{Code review notifications}
{
A cross-browser compatible extension built using WebExtension API for code review notifications.

Usually version control systems have poor built in system to handle notifications about what is happening in the review where user is participant or owner of it. Some already developed integrations do not meet the development team expectations or just does not exist. Receiving mails as notification is the same uncomfortable as our version control system sens a lot of mails everyday. At some point it is going to be considered as spam and turned off.
} 
{
The goal is to create a light solution for a browser (which is opened almost all the time) with rich but not disturbing notification system and check-in list to keep those review requests organized and always have them around.

The extension is intended to work with GitHub and GitLab git-repository platforms.

{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Basic knowledge about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for being able to write browser extensions.

{Multiplayer Action race game}
{
Create a 2D multiplayer action game where players race through a platformer-style "city" map, trying to get on top of highest buildings and installing BTS-es/Antennas for their team. General rules/ideas:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A crossover between Icy Tower and Mirror's Edge 2D
	\item Players try to climb up the highest points, but there are difficulties on the way that can cause them to fall down (see Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy)
	\item Players can interrupt others / knock them down on the way
	\item Possible game types: Race to the top, Capture the BTS, Install as many BTSes in a given time
\end{itemize}
}
{
Scope:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Multiplayer Game engine that allows players to move across a 2D side scroller map, interact with each others and complete objectives
	\item Preferably the game should be runnable in browser
	\item Optional: Map Editor

{Comparing graph databases}
{
Based on prepared dataset that describes relations between ancestors (family tree) you will have to present those relations in a tree form, store and transform them using graph databases:
\begin{itemize}
	\item OrientDB
	\item HGraphDB
\end{itemize}
As a conclusion you should compare those two databases based on performance and convenience for that task.
}
{
Following project includes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Storing and presenting relation data in tree form in graph databases
	\item Scripts that perform transformations on the data, such as:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item retrieve n-th ancestor/child based on relation column
			\item filter children based on column value
			\item get all elements with given ancestor
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
