{Video stream processing for an e-Health system}
{
\begin{small}
Provide video stream processing functionalities, which enable touchless monitoring of the condition and behavior of individuals.
 
Video monitoring is a part of a larger e-Health system where data streams from different types of sensors are processed and combined with data from other relevant sources (e.g. information about medical treatment).
An important part of the video stream processing is anonymization functionality, which shall ensure privacy of the monitored individuals while keeping the information which is necessary to extract valuable insights via video analytics.
\end{small}
}
{
\begin{small}
Main scope:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Capture video stream from a camera.
	\item Transfer securely the video stream for a pre-processing by a video stream anonymizer.
	\item Adding, editing and removing inventory items in database by web app.
	\item Provide a video stream anonymization functionality. Use existing open source resources, like e.g. \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/DensePose}, as far as feasible.
	\item Transfer securely the anonymized video to the video analytics system.
\end{itemize}
In case you are willing to go some extra miles you have different options:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Consider basing the processing on WWS (\url{https://www.worldwidestreams.io/}) - a stream processing platform created by Nokia Bell Labs.
	\item Add video analytics functionalities like:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item extraction of vital signs (e.g. pulse and respiration rates, body temperature). Use e.g. \url{https://github.com/Pwan101/pulsefromheadmotion};
			\item sleep quality monitoring;
			\item sleep quality monitoring;
			\item mood identification;
			\item behavior anomaly detection.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Synchronize the video stream with data streams from other monitoring sources, like wearables (e.g. \url{https://www.imec-int.com/en/chill}, \url{https://www.imec-int.com/en/circuitry-sensor-hubs/disposable-health-patch}) and environmental sensors (e.g. light intensity and noise levels).
	\item Evaluate the potential benefits of Edge Cloud processing, e.g. using Airframe Open Edge Server \url{https://networks.nokia.com/products/airframe-open-edge-server}
	\item Consider usability of blockchain in ensuring the data security.

	\item Make, make, make:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item o	Use the NB-IoT modem in combination with sensors and/or actuators and whatever else you need. Note that you can start with a WiFi connectivity and introduce an NB-IoT connectivity afterwards.
			\item o	Iteratively improve your prototype.
