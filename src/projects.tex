{UI issue feedback}
{A Chrome (web browser) extension or web application for finding and selecting those parts of web application (website) which are considered as ugly, bugged or defected.}
{
Following project includes: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item An extension or web application for giving feedback about unliked part of application with a visual preview (an image or live) of that part (or the entire page with those parts selected).

Developing applications by group of developers comes with troubles with making an agreement of visual aspects or functionality of an app. Writing e-mails and describing something using only text consume too much time and sometimes just doesn't work, specially if one feature has more than one author. Gathering feedbacks from many sources is also hard.

Project described above makes this whole process faster, easier and much cleaner, specially for someone who is responsible for fixing.
