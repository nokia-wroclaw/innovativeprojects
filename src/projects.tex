{SSL/TLS support in Facebook Presto big data drivers}
{Extend Facebook Presto MongoDB and Cassandra drivers with SSL/TLS connectivity.} 
{
Presto is a distributed-query engine from Facebook that allows cross-querying different databases.

Connection to particular database implementation is handled by Connectors. Presto connectors lack support for SSL connections to databases, that would allow for connections between Presto and databases via non-separated, even public network. At the moment such configuration requires setup of many SSH tunnels.
