{Django package to import and correlate data from external sources}
{Information society relies on the processes of retrieving, storing and correlating data from various sources. These processes are part of everyday work of a developer in a technical company such as Nokia. Yet, the business component of this process is changing constantly, which requires continues changes to the code. The purpose of this package is to create an abstraction layer for business logic related to fetching data from various sources (API, CSV, Excel), storing it and creating relations between tables/data sources.}
{
Creating reusable Django app that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allows to manage (through config files or later API) data sources
	\item Automatically create and maintain models
	\item Let the user define relations between data sources
	\item Provide API using Django Rest Framework
\end{itemize}
}

{Noticrawl - a web scraper and notifier}
{An app that mimics user's behavior to crawl into webpage, extract desired content, and notify if it changes.
A browser extension records what the user does on a page to get into desired content. Then it sends the instruction to a server that replays those steps in user-defined interval and notifies the user if there is a change.}
{
\begin{itemize}
	\item The server application should use a headless browser so it is always up to date with ever-changing web standards.
	\item Secure data upload from the web extension.
	\item User-defined schedules.
	\item The notfication should optionally provide a screenshot.
	\item Should be able to manage multiple users.
	\item Pluggable notification modules (e.g. mail, IRC, slack - depending on the size of the group)

\begin{project}
{Is my computer locked?}
{The project consists of two simple applications in the server-client architecture. The client notifies the server in real-time whether the computer is locked or unlocked. The server provides a web-view of the current status with a button that blocks the computer.}
{
Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The application must be served through HTTPS on port 443 to be allowed by a corporate firewall.
	\item The client must be properly authenticated by the server.
	\item Gnome-shell integration and an alternative that just executes user-defined shell commands.
	\item Simple registration that allows multiple clients to be connected simultaneously.
	\item The registration can be disabled and client access rights can be set manually in a configuration file.
\end{itemize}
Extra points:
\begin{itemize}
	\item KDE integration.
	\item The client can register custom actions that can be triggered by the server. This is defined in client's configuration file.
	\item The server throttles the connection if the client seems rogue.
\end{itemize}
}
{
Recommended stack:
\begin{itemize}
