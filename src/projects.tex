{Time Tracking Helper}
{Develop a tool that will help to track office hours of employees.} 
{ 
A company X hires a lot of workers. Workers track their work-time in excel, which is not handy and error-prone.

Project assumes development of two elements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Chrome plugin
		\begin{itemize}
			\item track daily work hours of employee and send that information to server
		\end{itemize}
	\item Web application
		\begin{itemize}
			\item visualizes work hours (timeline)
			\item displays additional information about work hours (week target, week overtime etc.)
			\item sends notification to manager about employee status
			\item generates reports
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

			\item monitors web services and generates and closes alarms when web applications are not responsive or has failing healthchecks
			\item serves the mobile phone app
		\end{itemize}
	\item Android/mobile phone application
		\begin{itemize}

{NERD - NEwcomer Request Delivery}
{Develop a tool that will speed up / automate newcomer enablement process by adding new user to projects, sending mail requests or manuals, and creating Jira tickets via REST API.} 
{
Manager wants to give access rights to tools required to work with project for every member that joins development team (Jenkins, application server, Jira, confluence, GIT repository, etc). There also must be mail notifications to development team and product owner about new team member. Newcomer should get mail with set of instructions/manuals/requrements.

There are two steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project configuration in NERD Tool:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Add email sending function:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Configure target email and message/content. Mail message template can be edited with BBCode or Markdown.
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\item Add jira ticket creation function:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Configure target Jira address/project id and ticket description
			\item Send access rights request for given user:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Choose previously configured project and attach user to it by his email address
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}
{
Minimal experience or eager to learn:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Language for backend logic (i.e. Java + Play Framework)
	\item Language for frontend logic (i.e. JavaScript + Angular2 or Java + Vaadin)
	\item Data Base knowledge (i.e. Postgres + Ebean ORM or SQL)
	\item REST web services

{SSL/TLS support in Facebook Presto big data drivers}
{Extend Facebook Presto MongoDB and Cassandra drivers with SSL/TLS connectivity.} 
{
Presto is a distributed-query engine from Facebook that allows cross-querying different databases.

Connection to particular database implementation is handled by Connectors. Presto connectors lack support for SSL connections to databases, that would allow for connections between Presto and databases via non-separated, even public network. At the moment such configuration requires setup of many SSH tunnels.
