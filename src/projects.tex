\bigbreak
Proposal functionalities:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item General view (only for admins):
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Projects management - adding/editing/removing projects, assigning members to them
			\item Users management - adding/editing/removing users
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Single project view (available only for assigned users):
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Main dashboard with list of open Action Items and all Working Agreements set by the team
			\item Board with availability of posts creation.
			\item Post can have different category (new idea, code improvement etc.).
			\item Adding comments to posts.

{
Manager wants to give access rights to tools required to work with project for every member that joins development team (Jenkins, application server, Jira, confluence, GIT repository, etc). There also must be mail notifications to development team and product owner about new team member. Newcomer should get mail with set of instructions/manuals/requrements.
\bigbreak
There are two steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project configuration in NERD Tool:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Add email sending function:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Configure target email and message/content. Mail message template can be edited with BBCode or Markdown.
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\item Add jira ticket creation function:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Configure target Jira address/project id and ticket description
			\item Send access rights request for given user:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Choose previously configured project and attach user to it by his email address
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

{SSL/TLS support in Facebook Presto big data drivers}
{Extend Facebook Presto MongoDB and Cassandra drivers with SSL/TLS connectivity.}
{
Presto is a distributed-query engine from Facebook that allows cross-querying different databases.

Connection to particular database implementation is handled by Connectors. Presto connectors lack support for SSL connections to databases, that would allow for connections between Presto and databases via non-separated, even public network. At the moment such configuration requires setup of many SSH tunnels.
