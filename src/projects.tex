{Lightweight C++11 code model}
{Develop a plugin for Vim or Emacs which uses Clang to provide real-time
syntax highlighting, code completion and error/warning indication} 
{ 
Modern C++ IDEs such as Qt Creator or Microsoft Visual Studio provide code
models for real-time syntactic and semantic code analysis. This greatly enhances 
the programming experience, allowing for faster and more convenient development. 
However, sometimes developers are required to work on remote machines, e.g. via SSH. 
In such circumstances it is impossible to use heavy tools with sophisticated GUIs. 
On the other hand, console text editors do not provide satisfactory code models. 
Existing plugins are often difficult to configure and aimed mainly at graphical versions of the editors. 
They also cause significant problems when new C++11 constructs are used. The growing popularity of Clang,
a modern compiler which supports the full C++11 standard and provides a convenient API, seems to indicate 
the possibility to provide a lightweight plugin for one of the popular console text editors such as Vim or 
Emacs â€“ one that would support real-time syntax highlighting, code completion, compiler error/warning indication. 
 
The plugin will have to be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] Load projects, preferably using CMake input files.
	\item[-] Parse the headers and source files belonging to the project as well as
	system libraries to provide a list of available symbols.
	\item[-] Perform on-the-fly code inspection, verifying its syntactic correctness and the symbols used.
	\item[-] Provide real-time information on types of variables, class members and function arguments.
	\item[-] Locate class and function declarations and definitions.

{Lost signal}
{Finding closest position with the mobile network signal} 
{ 
Let assume that we are picking up mushrooms in a forest or we are climbing in
the mountains. Our friend had an accident. We need to call for help. Our mobile
says: \textit{Sorry dude, no signal}. We are in a deep shit.\linebreak

Application could periodically test the network signal and correlate this data
with our position from GPS. Then, if needed, it could lead us to the closest
position with the last visible signal. Application can also consist of web service that would
gather the data from other users and would allow to download the area coverage
for the offline usage. It can also use maps (HERE, Google, etc.) for the
localization purposes.

{Where is my boss?}
{Mobile application for finding coworkers and user location in a building} 
{ 
We are living in environment with abundance of radio signals. Some signal are easy to receive on long distance
(for instance FM radio) and some are designed to serve on smaller area
(\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon}).
Wi-Fi has range about 60 meters. All devices which are designed to use Wi-Fi can calculate Received Signal 
Strength Indication (RSSI) which tells the device about power of received radio signal. Such RSSI could
(with simple and naive approach) tell how far we are from source of signal. If
there are many Wi-Fi fields, we can estimate our position based on RSSI from different sources.\newline

Goal of project would be to produce application which will work in two modes.
First mode (lets name it Scout Mode) will run periodical checks of Wi-Fi RSSI from all sources in "sight".
After Scouting the area (just by walking with device), data will be saved and pushed to data mining program
(either on device or on remote server). Data mining program will try to classify data based on one parameter - 
number of rooms, floors etc. Then application could be switched to second mode (Location mode) which will 
check Wi-Fi RSSI for current location, push it to data mining script and receive result. With some luck result
could give indicator in which room/floor user is currently. The same
data can be used for determining position of other application users.\newline

Project should be implemented either on Android or on Linux, preferably by using
Android SDK or Python. Knowledge of unsupervised learning techniques are not required.
