Main goal of application is to support programming workshops. Application should allow workshop creation dedicated for any programming language.
\bigbreak
Proposal functionalities:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Working examples - code with explanations and working results.
	\item Syntax highlighting.
	\item Splitting material into chapters - in each chapter we extend code from the previous one (it is like building application in steps).

{Retro Tool}
{Web application for supporting Retrospective Meetings.}
{
Retrospective Meeting is part of Scrum methodology. During this meeting, team reflects the past Sprint, discuss on improvements, identifies good practices. The result of the Retrospective is set of Working Agreements (set of rules/disciplines/processes the team agrees to follow) and Action Items (small task assigned to team member to be done before next Retrospective Meetings).
\bigbreak
Application should allow management of several projects and create new posts in each of them and also show board with Working Agreements and Action Items.
\bigbreak
Proposal functionalities:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item General view (only for admins):
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Projects management - adding/editing/removing projects, assigning members to them
			\item Users management - adding/editing/removing users
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Single project view (available only for assigned users):
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Main dashboard with list of open Action Items and all Working Agreements set by the team
			\item Board with availability of posts creation.
			\item Post can have different category (new idea, code improvement etc.).
			\item Adding comments to posts.

{NERD - NEwcomer Request Delivery}
{Develop a tool that will speed up / automate newcomer enablement process by adding new user to projects, sending mail requests or manuals, and creating Jira tickets via REST API.} 
{
Manager wants to give access rights to tools required to work with project for every member that joins development team (Jenkins, application server, Jira, confluence, GIT repository, etc). There also must be mail notification aimed to development team and product owner about new team member. Newcomer should get mail with set of instructions/manuals/requrements for quick start-up.
\bigbreak
There are two main use scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project configuration in NERD Tool via web gui:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Setup of messages to be sent on new team member arrival
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Configuration of message/content. Mail message template can be edited with BBCode or Markdown.
					\item Configuration of list of recepients 
				\end{itemize}
			\item Configuration of issues to be created on Jira service - target project, required fields etc
		\end{itemize}
	\item New team member arrival - particular group of people can trigger actions configured in previous step for newcomer
\end{itemize}
}
{
Minimal experience or eager to learn:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Some language for backend logic (i.e. Java + Play Framework)
	\item Some language for frontend logic (i.e. JavaScript + Angular2 or Java + Vaadin)
	\item Database knowledge
	\item RESTful web services

{Cross-applications shortcuts as a web component}
{When many web services are operated and advertised by one entity (department, company, whatever) it is wise to have consistent way to easily move user bwetween applications. Good example are Google web apps or Microsoft web apps, where it's always obvious how to jump between services in given company portfolio - by using same looking shortcuts button in every application. The goal of the project is to have web-based service that would allow for creation, maangement and display of such common component for consistent linking to many web applicatiions/pages.} 
{
Minimal finished project allows for:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Separate web application where one can 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item create new apps - with their icons and links
			\item order or position of particlar application on applications list
		\end{itemize}
	\item Web component in any technology, that can be embedded in navbar of any application, and when clicked will display list of applications user can jump to with clickable links/anchors.
\end{itemize}
Possible extension: created app could monitor health of linked applications and disable/enable or modify view of the links displayed depending on the status of linked application (unresponsive, maintanance or similar).

{SSL/TLS support in Facebook Presto big data drivers}
{Extend Facebook Presto MongoDB and Cassandra drivers with SSL/TLS connectivity.}
{
Presto is a distributed-query engine from Facebook that allows cross-querying different databases.

Connection to particular database implementation is handled by Connectors. Presto connectors lack support for SSL connections to databases, that would allow for connections between Presto and databases via non-separated, even public network. At the moment such configuration requires setup of many SSH tunnels.
